# automatic-rescue-driver-allocation
In this project, a machine learning model is built to assist Berlin's red cross rescue service to allocate standby drivers more efficiently than the original method of allocating 90 per day every day.

Various scripts have been created to handle different tasks such as data exploration, data quality checking, data cleaning, model training, etc.
These scripts have been numbered to represent the order of the tasks.
